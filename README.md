Group Project:

Develop a 2D computer game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm.
The requirements:

- Graphical 2D game
Using a simple graphical library called WinBGIm for showing graphical-based output onto the screen

- Implementation of OOP
Encapsulation, Association (composition and aggregation), Inheritance, and Polymorphism

Language used: C++
Software used: Visual Studio Code

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps to run the program:

1. Download Visual Studio Code and install C/C++ language in the "Extensions" page.
2. Download the whole "Space-Shooter" folder. (You can just download the "Spaceshooter.cpp" file if you already have those configuration files.)
3. Open Visual Studio Code and click the "File" button at the top left corner.
4. Click the "Open Folder" button and choose the "Space-Shooter" folder that you have downloaded just now.
5. Click the "Spaceshooter.cpp" file in the "Explorer" page.
6. Click the "Run and Debug" page and change "Console program" to "Graphic program" / "WinBGIm program".
7. Click the play icon button to start debugging. (You can press F5 to start debugging as well.)
8. Do take note for both program (command prompt and WinBGIm program) to have a better gaming experience.
